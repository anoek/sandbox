= VM Testing

This directory contains various scripts used for testing on different VM images. This is
used to test on different file systems, different mount points, different distributions,
and different architectures.

The scripts are numbered and should in general be run in order. They are intended to be
idempotent, so can be run independently if there is a part that is failing.
