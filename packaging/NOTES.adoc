= Packaging Notes

== Binary




== Shell completion

You can enable shell completion for the `sandbox` command by adding the
following snippets to the appropriate shell configuration files, or
if you're packaging the shell completion and both will be updated together
you can expand the shell scripts to avoid the runtime execution of the
`sandbox` binary to generate the completion scripts.


### bash

```bash
source <(COMPLETE=bash sandbox)
```

### zsh

```bash
source <(COMPLETE=zsh sandbox)
```

### fish

```sh
source (COMPLETE=fish sandbox | psub)
```

### elvish

```sh
eval (E:COMPLETE=elvish sandbox | slurp)
```
